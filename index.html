<h3> <b>H@CKGTBIT</b></h3>
<hr>
<b>COME FALL IN LOVE WITH CODING!</b>
All your life you’ve been dreaming for a chance to compete amongst the best coders
and beat them to become the best coder in the room. Well, this is your chance to
swank your skills and bring all of those dreams to life as<b> HELLO WORLD</b> brings
to you it’s biggest and most promising event, the Hackathon.
H@CK GTBIT is an initiative to provide students of our college only a platform to
solve some of pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a
culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem solving.
A hackathon is a tool for problem solving, where a group of people gather to find
solutions to a given challenge. Hackathons aim to focus on ‘developing innovative
technologies’ for the challenges faced by the entrepreneurs, start-ups and
This is a 24-hour Open to All classes Coding event and the teams will be judged on
their usage of the full analytics process - incorporating not only the technical
analysis and solution, but also the understanding of the business problem. The
solutions presented must hold clarity, technical strength of methodology and
uniqueness of approach. 
It is an opportunity to learn from the best, network with the best, and compete with
the best. 
<b>TIMELINE</b>
The timeline will be segregated into different phases which are:
<span class="underline">Phase 1</span> All participants will be provided with multiple themes. They will have to
choose one out of the many themes and develop a prototype with the same.
<span class="underline">Phase 2</span> Evaluation of the progress of the prototype.
<span class="underline">Phase 3</span> Presentation of the complete prototype for final evaluation.
<span class="underline">Phase 4</span> Segregation of the teams into top 10.
<span class="underline">Phase 5</span>Pitching by top 10 teams.
<b>TIMINGS 10 am to 3pm both dates</b>
1. Registration begins at 10 am on 18 th January
2. Announcement of topics
3. 3 pm Each team will share their ideas with the judgement panel
who will be helping with some tips on the same and then can
leave.
4. 10 am on 19 th January each team will present their ideas and
implementation of the same would be under a scan.

5. After which results would be announced and the event would be
declared close.

<b>RULES</b>
<span class="underline">Team Size:</span>
A maximum of 4 members are allowed in a team. All 4 members can be of any year
but should be of our college only. If you are making a team from 4 th year then you
should have a 1 st year student in it else your team will not be approved.

<span class="underline">Equipment:</span>
Participants have to bring their own laptops. Extension cords and internet access will
be provided.

<span class="underline">Food:</span>

<b>Judgement Criteria
We all know it’s tough to judge each and every team on the same scale as you are
of different year so there will be segregation of teams on the bases of years and the
judgement would be done.</b>

<span class="underline">Originality of idea :</span>
Everyone starts coding at the same time and no one should come in and build on top
of their existing projects. Due attribution should be given to any kind of boilerplate
code used.

<span class="underline">Final Decision:</span>
The ultimate decision regarding awards and prizes lies within the hands of jury which
will be your faculty only. The decision of organisers will be final and binding. 	
technology enthusiasts across the world.

									Are you planning on studying coding to build a rock solid foundation or willing to expand your skill base for opening a wider field of opportunities? 

All major tech companies compete to hire the coders with best skill. Coding has constantly being bridging the world to bring about minds with ideas and evolve a world of technology and advancement. With constantly increasing competitions abd brains involved in coding isn't it necessary to become excel?<br> 

So what makes a coder excel his field- it's the right guidance and practise. <br>
Under right guidance one learns more than the just the topic. The right guidance brings encouragement on every failure. <br>
Practice not just makes a coder excellent in coding but tends to bring about confidence in learners for his future endeavour.<br> 
  
        ‘Hello World’ strives to teach you coding from the scratch with a clear and concise training.
