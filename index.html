<b>COME FALL IN LOVE WITH CODING!</b>
All your life you’ve been dreaming for a chance to compete amongst the best coders
and beat them to become the best coder in the room. Well, this is your chance to
swank your skills and bring all of those dreams to life as<b> HELLO WORLD</b> brings

H@CK GTBIT is an initiative to provide students of our college only a platform to
solve some of pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a
culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem solving.
A hackathon is a tool for problem solving, where a group of people gather to find
solutions to a given challenge. Hackathons aim to focus on ‘developing innovative
technologies’ for the challenges faced by the entrepreneurs, start-ups and
This is a 24-hour Open to All classes Coding event and the teams will be judged on
their usage of the full analytics process - incorporating not only the technical
analysis and solution, but also the understanding of the business problem. The
solutions presented must hold clarity, technical strength of methodology and
uniqueness of approach. 
It is an opportunity to learn from the best, network with the best, and compete with
the best. 
<b>TIMELINE</b>
The timeline will be segregated into different phases which are:
<span class="underline">Phase 1</span> All participants will be provided with multiple themes. They will have to
choose one out of the many themes and develop a prototype with the same.
<span class="underline">Phase 2</span> Evaluation of the progress of the prototype.
<span class="underline">Phase 3</span> Presentation of the complete prototype for final evaluation.
<span class="underline">Phase 4</span> Segregation of the teams into top 10.
<span class="underline">Phase 5</span>Pitching by top 10 teams.
<b>TIMINGS 10 am to 3pm both dates</b>

of different year so there will be segregation of teams on the bases of years and the
judgement would be done.</b>

<span class="underline">Originality of idea :</span>
Everyone starts coding at the same time and no one should come in and build on top
of their existing projects. Due attribution should be given to any kind of boilerplate
code used.

The ultimate decision regarding awards and prizes lies within the hands of jury which
will be your faculty only. The decision of organisers will be final and binding.
